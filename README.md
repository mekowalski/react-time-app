# React Timezone App

This is for learning more about Class Components and the fundamentals

Kowalski, are you there?

## App Summary
- This Application I created to practice the basics of React's Class-based Components and State
- I used JavaScript's `Date()` built-in object to retrieve the user's time
- `Date.getHour()` is used to provide the numerical value in order to help determine what time of day it is
- The time of day conditionals are: morning, afternoon and night
- There are no conditionals to handle error messages and loading
- What was learned and implemented:
  - Benefits and rules of Class Components
  - State that was procedural, basic and synchronous
  - Rules of State
